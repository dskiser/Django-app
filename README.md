# Django App

This repository contains a web app called Budget KeepR that allows users to track their spending.  The inspiration for this project comes from Eric Matthes' *Python Crash Course*, and the purpose was to become more familiar with django, practice python, and create an app that would help me and wife keep better track of our spending.

Budget KeepR can be visited at https://budget-keeper.herokuapp.com/
